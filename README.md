# ESP-Wifi-AP-Neopixel-Control

The files in this repository should work for setting an ESP first into Access Point (AP) mode and then allowing you to send your SSID
and password to the ESP and then flip it to be a clinet and connect your chosen network. Once connected you should be able to use another
html page to control RGB Lights.
